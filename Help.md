MacroHub Help & Troubleshooting Guide (EXE Version)

This guide covers the most common issues, fixes, and tips for users running the MacroHub EXE.


🟢 First-Time User Tips

✔ 1. Run the EXE as Administrator
Right-click → Run as administrator  
This ensures the macro can send key inputs correctly.

✔ 2. Create an account and use it to login to the macro.
(also enter your license key ofcourse)

✔ 3. Make sure Minecraft is the active window
MacroHub only sends input to the focused window.  
If you click Discord, Chrome, etc — the macro will stop moving.

✔ 4. Start with small A/D hold times
Use the K and L keys to adjust movement timing.
Shorter times = less drifting.

✔ 5. Stay consistent
Use the same:
- FOV  
- Sensitivity  
- Farm layout  
for best performance.


🟠 Common Issues & Fixes

❗ Macro doesn’t move at all
Fixes
- Make sure Minecraft is selected  
- Run the EXE as administrator  
- Check if your “Move Left/Right” keys are still A and D

❗ Auto-Warp does nothing
Fixes
- Press O to enable Auto-Warp  
- Make sure your warp cooldown is “Ready”

Fixes

- Ensure "Destroy" is bound to Space   
- Macro won't work if you are in menus or chat

❗ Macro drifts sideways over time
Causes & Fixes:

❗ Movement stops randomly
Likely triggered by Auto-Stop.

Fix: Press F9 to disable Auto-Stop or F8 to re-enable it.
